# Hangman
This is a hangmen game in python
The code asks for the user to input their name and will print out their name with
different dialogues as the game goes on

The user is given 10 tries to guess the word, and if the user does not get the word within 
10 tries, we reveal what the answer was

Update: implemented the difficulties of hangmen, the game is completed for now.
